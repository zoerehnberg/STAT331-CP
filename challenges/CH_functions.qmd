A frequently used measurement for fish health is a condition index [(Wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_index_in_fish). The following simple equation can be used to calculate the approximate condition index of a fish:

$$\text{condition index} = \frac{weight}{length^3} \times 100$$

**1. There are specific units required for the calculation of a condition index -- length must be in centimeters and weight must be in grams. The weight data for the Blackfoot River fish were collected in grams; the length data were collected in millimeters. Transform the length data to the correct units.**

```{r}
# Code for 1
```

**2. Replace impossible `length` and `weight` measurements with `NA`s. Do some research on the 4 species of trout included in these data to determine what measurements are unlikely or impossible. Write a function to handle this process.**

Your function should accept at least three inputs:

+ a vector of measurements,
+ the minimum value you believe is "reasonable,"
+ the maximum value you believe is "reasonable." 

If a value falls outside these bounds, you should replace it with an `NA`.

::: callout-tip
If you are struggling with the structure of your function, I would suggest reading the [Mutating Function](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/functions.html#mutate-functions) from R4DS.
:::

Use your function to modify the `length` and `weight` columns of the `BlackfootFish` data set, removing values you believe are unreasonable.

```{r}
# Code for 2
```

**3. Write a function to calculate the condition index of a fish, given inputs of weight and length.**

::: callout-warning
Consider whether your function will accept vectors as inputs or if it will accept variable names as inputs!
:::

```{r}
# Code for 3
```

**4. Make a thoughtful visualization of how fish conditions have varied over the duration of this study.**

```{r}
# Code for 4
```
