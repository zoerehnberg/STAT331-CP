For this lab, you will be joining and filtering related datasets to solve a murder mystery!


## Instructions

Northwestern University's Knight Lab wanted to help sharpen users' database skills, so they created a murder mystery. Can you solve this crime in SQL City??

The relational data you will be working with contains tables with different pieces of information pertinent to the crime - people, social media check-ins, driver's licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more!

![Database schema](https://mystery.knightlab.com/schema.png)

Solve the murder mystery, showing **all of your work in this document**. Your document and code must be well organized, easy to follow, and reproducible.

+ Use headers and written descriptions to indicate what you are doing.
+ Use `dplyr` verbs and `join` functions rather than just looking through the tables manually.
+ Use good code formatting practices.
+ Comment your code.
+ Cite any external sources you use to solve the mystery.

::: callout-tip

You may find the `pull()` function handy for displaying each clue as you go along.

## Access the Data

This code chunk will read in all of the tables of data for you. Don't modify or remove this!

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
if (!"purrr" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("purrr")
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoerehnberg/STAT331-S23/main/challenges/bCH_murder_setup.R")
```

## Solve the Crime

### Crime Scene Report

Detective Wickham reaches out to you...

> A crime has taken place and I need your help! There was a murder in SQL City sometime on Jan.15, 2018. Could you retrieve the crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database and follow the clues to find the murderer?!

```{r}
# Code for looking at the relevant crime scene report.
```


**Follow the evidence to the murderer, building a report as you go.**
