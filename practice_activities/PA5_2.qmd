```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Pick your poison!

You may choose to work through Q1 - Q6 using a data.frame `message_data` and follow the `dplyr` pipeline syntax...

```{r}
message_data <- read_csv("https://github.com/earobinson95/stat331-calpoly/raw/master/practice-activities/data/scrambled_message.txt")

class(message_data)
```

...or you might prefer to work with the character vector `message` and use indexing -- e.g. message[1] gives you the first element.

```{r}
message <- message_data |> 
  pull(Word)

class(message)
```

::: callout-tip
In this activity, a "word" is a set of characters with no white space. That is, even though many of elements of the scrambled mess vector are nonsense, and some have punctuation, you can consider each element to be a "word".
:::

## Warm-up exercises

1.  How many characters are in the scrambled message?

2.  How many words are in the scrambled message?

3.  Print out every word in the scrambled message that starts with the letter "m".

4.  Print out every word in the scrambled message that ends with the letter "z"

5.  Print out the punctuation symbols that are present in the scrambled message.

6.  Print out the longest word in the scrambled message.

## Decode the Message

::: callout-caution
You likely want to work with the `message` character vector for decoding.
:::

Complete the following steps to decode the message.

1.  Remove any spaces before or after each word.

2.  No word should be longer than 16 characters. Drop all extra characters off the end of each word.

3.  Any time you see the word "ugh", with any number of h's, followed by a punctuation mark, delete this.

4.  Replace all instances of exactly 2 a's with exactly 2 e's.

5.  Replace all z's with t's.

6.  Every word that ends in b, change that to a y.

7.  Every word that starts with k (or K), change that to a v (or V).

8.  Recombine all your words into a message.

9.  Find the movie this quote is from.
