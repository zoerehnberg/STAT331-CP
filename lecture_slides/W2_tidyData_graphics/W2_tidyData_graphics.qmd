## Same Data, Different Formats

Which data follows a tidy data format?

```{r tidy-data}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data <- tibble(Team     = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                       Points   = c(88, 91, 99, 94),
                       Assists  = c(12, 17, 24, 28),
                       Rebounds = c(22, 28, 30, 31)
                       )
```

::: panel-tabset
### Option 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Option 2

```{r}
#| echo: false
bb_tidy_data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols      = c(Points, Assists, Rebounds),
               names_to  = "Variable",

# Working with External Data


## Common Types of Data Files

Look at the **file extension** for the type of data file.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

`.csv` :  "comma-separated values"

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```
Name, Age
Bob, 49
Joe, 40
```
:::

::::

. . .

`.xls, .xlsx`:  Microsoft Excel spreadsheet

  + Common approach: save as `.csv`
  + Nicer approach:  use the `readxl` package

. . .

`.txt`:  plain text

  + Could be comma-separated, tab-separated, bar-separated...
  + Need to let R know what to look for!


## Loading External Data

Using base `R` functions:

- `read.csv()` is for reading in `.csv` files.

- `read.table()` and `read.delim()` are for any data with "columns" (you specify the separator).


## Loading External Data

The tidyverse has some cleaned-up versions in the `readr` and `readxl` packages: 

- `read_csv()` is for comma-separated data.

- `read_tsv()` is for tab-separated data.

- `read_table()` is for white-space-separated data.

- `read_delim()` is any data with "columns" (you specify the separator). The above are special cases.

- `read_excel()` is specifically for dealing with Excel files.

Remember to load the `readr` and `readxl` packages first!

# Grammar of Graphics


## Grammar of Graphics

The Grammar of Graphics (GoG) is a principled way of specifying **exactly** how to create a particular graph from a given data set. It helps us to systematically design new graphs.

. . .

<br>

Think of a graph or a data visualization as a mapping...

...**FROM variables** in the data set (or statistics computed from the data)...

...**TO visual attributes** (or "aesthetics") **of marks** (or "geometric elements") on the page/screen.


## Why Grammar of Graphics?

+ It's more flexible than a "chart zoo" of named graphs.
+ The software understands the structure of your graph.
+ It easily automates graphing of data subsets.
  
. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
## *ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis* by Hadley Wickham
The grammar makes it easier for you to iteratively update a plot, changing a single feature at a time. The grammar is also useful because it suggests the high-level aspects of a plot that *can* be changed, giving you a framework to think about graphics, and hopefully shortening the distance from mind to paper. It also encourages the use of graphics customised to a particular problem, rather than relying on specific chart types.
:::


## Components of Grammar of Graphics

+ `data`: dataframe containing variables
+ `aes` : aesthetic mappings (position, color, symbol, ...)
+ `geom` : geometric element (point, line, bar, box, ...)
+ `stat` : statistical variable transformation (identity, count, linear model, quantile, ...)
+ `scale` : scale transformation (log scale, color mapping, axes tick breaks, ...)
+ `coord` : Cartesian, polar, map projection, ...
+ `facet` : divide into subplots using a categorical variable


# Using `ggplot2`


## How to build a graph

![](https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/images/ggplot2-notation.png)


##

::: panel-tabset

### Add data

This begins a plot that you can add layers to:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

### Add aesthetics

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 4.5
#| fig-width: 4.5
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       )
```

### Add one `geom` per layer

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
#| fig-height: 6
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       ) +
  geom_jitter()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "5"
#| fig-height: 6
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       aes(x = class, y = hwy)
       ) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_boxplot()
```

:::

How would you make the points be **on top** of the boxplots?

::::
:::

## Aesthetics

We map **variables** from the data set to **aesthetics** on the chart.

+ This uses the `aes()` function.

. . .

What aesthetics can we set?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

+ x, y
+ color and fill
+ linetype
+ lineend

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

+ linejoin
+ size
+ shape

### Game Plan

![](images/txhousing_plan.png)

### ggplot

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
ggplot(data = txhousing, aes(x = date, y = median, color = city)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Median Home Price") + 
  ggtitle("Texas Housing Prices")
```

### Special Properties

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Global Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"
ggplot(data = housingsub, 
       mapping = aes(x = date, 
                     y = median)
       ) +
  geom_point()
```

**Local Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2-3"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median)
             )
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Mapping Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median,
                           color = city)
             )
```

**Setting Aesthetics**

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "4"
ggplot(data = housingsub) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = date, 
                           y = median), 
             color = "blue"
               )
```

:::
::::

:::


## Geometric Objects

Wee use a `geom_xxx()` function to represent data points, and the aesthetic properties to represent variables.

. . .

:::: {.columns}

<font size = "6">

::: {.column width="35%"}
**one variable**

+ `geom_density()`
+ `geom_dotplot()`
+ `geom_histogram()`
+ `geom_boxplot()`

:::
::: {.column width="35%"}

**two variable**

+ `geom_point()`
+ `geom_line()`
+ `geom_density_2d()`

:::
::: {.column width="30%"}

**three variable**

+ `geom_contour()`
+ `geom_raster()`

::: panel-tabset

### geom_point()

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(data = mpg,
       aes(x = cty,
           y = hwy,
           color = class)
       ) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(xlab = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

### geom_text()

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center

  labs(xlab = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

### geom_line()

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6"
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-align: center

           y = hwy,
           color = class)
       ) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(xlab = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

## Statistical Transformation: `stat`

A `stat` creates a new variable to plot (e.g., count, proportion).

<center>

![](https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/images/stat1.png)

</center>
## Faceting

Extracts subsets of data and places them in side-by-side graphics.

::: panel-tabset

### `facet_grid()`
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 2
#| fig-width: 12
#| code-line-numbers: "3"
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(.~class)
```


### Options
<font size = "6">

+ `facet_grid(. ~ b)`: facet into columns based on b
+ `facet_grid(a ~ .)`: facet into rows based on a
+ `facet_grid(a ~ b)`: facet into both rows and columns
+ `facet_wrap( ~ b)`: wrap facets into a rectangular layout

</font>

### Scales
You can set scales to let axis limits vary across facets:

`facet_grid(y ~ x, scales = ______)`

<font size = "6">

  + `"free"` -- both x- and y-axis limits adjust to individual facets
  + `"free_x"` -- only x-axis limits adjust
  + `"free_y"` -- only y-axis limits adjust

</font>


### Labels
You can set a labeller to adjust facet labels:

<font size = "6">

+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_both)`
+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_bquote(alpha ^ .(x)))`
+ `facet_grid(. ~ fl, labeller = label_parsed)`

</font>
:::


## Position Adjustements

Position adjustments determine how to arrange `geom`'s that would otherwise occupy the same space.

<font size = "6">

+ `position = 'dodge'`: Arrange elements side by side.
+ `position = 'fill'`: Stack elements on top of one another + normalize height.
+ `position = 'stack'`: Stack elements on top of one another.
+ `position = 'jitter"`: Add random noise to X & Y position of each element to avoid overplotting (see `geom_jitter()`).
 </font>

## Position Adjustements

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
ggplot(mpg, aes(fl, fill = drv)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "")`
```

## Plot Customizations

::: panel-tabset

### Labels

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "3-6"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x = "Engine Displacement (liters)", 
       y = "Highway MPG", 
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency")
```

### Themes
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "7-8"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(xlab = "Engine Displacement (liters)", 
       ylab = "Highway MPG", 
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Scales: Axes Ticks
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "6-9"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x     = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  scale_y_continuous("Highway MPG", 
                     limits = c(0,50),
                     breaks = seq(0,50,5)
                     )
```

### Scales: Color
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "7"
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-align: center
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl)) + 
  labs(x    = "Engine Displacement (liters)",
       y    = "Highway MPG",
       color = "Number of \nCylinders",
       title = "Car Efficiency") +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "white", high = "green4")
```
:::


## Formatting your Plot Code

It is good practice to put each `geom` and `aes` on a new line.

+ This makes code easier to read! 
+ Generally: no line of code should be over 80 characters long.

::: panel-tabset
### Bad Practice

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + labs(x = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

### Good Practice

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, 
                     y = hwy, 
                     color = class)
       ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "City (mpg)", 
       y = "Highway (mpg)"
       )
```

### Somewhere In bBetween

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)
       ) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = "City (mpg)", y = "Highway (mpg)")
```

Today we will...

+ Review PA 2: Using Data Visualization to Find the Penguins
+ [Ugly Graphics of Penguins](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bChpVMyrhBnOjJLwK1ku9uIcM6I-ZTTMXkY0200CHhw/edit#slide=id.p)
+ New Material
  + What makes a good graphic?
+ Lab 2: Exploring Rodents with ggplot2
+ Challenge 2: Spicing things up with ggplot2

## Why are some plots easier to read than others?

**What makes bad figures bad?**

::: panel-tabset

### aesthetic

Edward R. Tufte is a better known critic of this style of visualization:

+ Graphical excellence is the well-designed presentation of interesting data and consists of:
  + complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency
  + maximizes the “data-to-ink” ratio.
  + nearly always multivariate
  + requires telling the truth about the data.

+ defines "chartjunk" as superfluous details

### substantive

bad data.

### perceptual

Looking at pictures of data means looking at lines, shapes, and colors

Our visual system works in a way that makes some things easier for us to see than others

+ “Preattentive” features
+ Gestalt Principles
+ color and contrast

:::

## Good Graphics

Graphics consist of:

+ **Structure:** boxplot, scatterplot, etc.

+ **Aesthetics:** features such as color, shape, and size that map other characteristics to structural features

Both the structure and aesthetics should help viewers interpret the information.

# Gestalt Principles

## Gestalt Principles

What sorts of relationships are inferred, and under what circumstances?

::: panel-tabset
### Graphic

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/images/gestalt3.jpg")
```

### Features

+ **Proximity:** Things that are spatially near to one another are related.
+ **Similarity:** Things that look alike are related.
+ **Enlosure:** A group of related elements are surrounded with a visual element
+ **Symmetry:** If an object is asymmetrical, the viewer will waste time trying to find the problem instead of concentrating on the instruction.
+ **Closure:** Incomplete shapes are perceived as complete.
+ **Continuity:** Partially hidden objects are completed into familiar shapes.
+ **Connection:** Things that are visually tied to one another are related.
+ **Figure/Ground:** Visual elements are either in the foreground or the background.
:::

## Gestalt Principles

Gestalt Hierarchy	| Graphs
------------------| ------
Enclosure	        | Facets
Connection        |	Lines
Proximitiy	      | White Space
Similarity	      | Color/Shape

Implications for practice

+ Know how we perceive groups
+ Know that we perceive some groups before others
+ Design to facilitate and emphasize the most important comparisons

# Pre-attentive Features

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features

Pre-Attentive Features are things that "jump out" in less than 250 ms

+ Color, form, movement, spatial localization

There is a hierarchy of features

+ Color is stronger than shape
+ Combinations of pre-attentive features are usually not pre-attentive due to interference

## Pre-attentive Features: Double Encoding
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png")
```

## Pre-attentive Features: Double Encoding
```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png")
```

# Color

# Color

+ Hue: shade of color (red, orange, yellow...)

+ Intensity: amount of color

+ Both color and hue are pre-attentive. Bigger contrast corresponds to faster detection.

+ Use color to your advantage

+ When choosing color schemes, we will want mappings from data to color that are not just numerically but also perceptually uniform

+ Distinguish between sequential scales and categorical scales

## Color: Implications and Guidelines

+ Do not use rainbow color gradient schemes.
+ Avoid any scheme that uses green-yellow-red signaling if you have a target audience that may include colorblind people.
+ To “colorblind-proof” a graphic, you can use a couple of strategies:
  + double encoding - where you use color, use another aesthetic (line type, shape)
  + If you can print your chart out in black and white and still read it, it will be safe for colorblind users. This is the only foolproof way to do it!
  + If you are using a color gradient, use a monochromatic color scheme where possible.
  + If you have a bidirectional scale (e.g. showing positive and negative values), the safest scheme to use is purple - white - orange. In any color scale that is multi-hue, it is important to transition through white, instead of from one color to another directly.
+ Be conscious of what certain colors “mean”

## Gradients

::: panel-tabset

### Qualitative schemes

No more than 7 colors

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png")
```

Can use `colorRampPalette()` from the `RColorBrewer` package to produce larger palettes by interpolating existing ones

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png")
```


### Quantitative schemes

Use color gradient with only one hue for positive values

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png")
```

Use color gradient with two hues for positive and negative values. Gradient should go through a light, neutral color (white)

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("https://unl-statistics.github.io/R-workshops/02-r-graphics/knitr/4-Perception_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png")
```

:::

## Color in ggplot2

There are packages available for use that have color scheme options.

Some Examples:

+ Rcolorbrewer
+ ggsci
+ viridis
+ wes anderson

There are packages such as RColorBrewer and dichromat that have color palettes which are aesthetically pleasing, and, in many cases, colorblind friendly.

You can also take a look at other [ways to find nice color palettes](https://lisacharlottemuth.com/2016/04/22/Colors-for-DataVis/).
