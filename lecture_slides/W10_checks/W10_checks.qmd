Today we will...

+ Canvas Announcement
+ Cookie allergies?
+ Questions from Week 9: Linear Regression?
+ Data Intro + Cleaning: Feedback
+ New Material:
  + Predictive Checks
+ Final Project Work Time


## Data Intro + Cleaning: Feedback

**Your grade reflects the completeness of your submission, not the correctness!**

+ Describe **how** the data were collected, if provided.
  + E.g., how do we know the average life expectancy?
+ Explain **why** you performed your chosen cleaning steps.
+ This assignment is to assess **your learning in this course**. You are expected to use functions and code techniques from this class.
  + You will lose points for using non-tidyverse functions to do tasks that we have discussed in this class!


## Data Intro + Cleaning: Feedback

**Code:**

+ All code should be hidden -- use `echo: false`.
+ Don't name the `R` functions you have used ("We used `str_detect` to...".).
  + Instead, describe what you did in plain English.
+ Don't use dataset or variable names in the text.
  + Say "We removed missing values from per capita GDP." rather than "We removed `NA` from `per_cap_gdp`."
+ Don't print out the head of the data!


## Data Intro + Cleaning: Feedback

**Citations:**

+ Cite your sources, including:
  + data sources.
  + description of your variables that is not general knowledge.
+ You should have **both** in-line citations and a *References* section at the end of your report.


## Data Intro + Cleaning: Feedback

**Style + Organization:**

+ Define all acronyms, especially any that are related to the variables of interest.
+ Everything should be in paragraph form -- **no** bullets or numbered lists.
+ Read through your paper from top to bottom to make sure the organization makes sense.
  + At what point might someone get confused?


# Predictive Checks

> Any good analysis should include a check of the “adequacy of the fit of the model to the data and the plausibility of the model...” -- Andrew Gelman


## Predictive Checks

Predictive checks allow us to assess if our fitted model would produce data **similar to** the data that we observed.

+ Yes? Our model is a good fit.
+ No? Our model is not a good fit.

**This is an assessment of model fit.**

::: callout-caution
Predictive checks are **not** aimed to make predictions of the response variable for new observations of the explanatory variable.
:::

## Recall: Linear Regression

For simple linear regression, we assume the responses can be modeled as **a linear function of the explanatory variable and some error**.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \varepsilon$$

We also assume that those errors $(\varepsilon)$ follow a **normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma$**.

$$\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma)$$


## Recall: Linear Regression

Therefore, the data **we would expect** to come from this model can be generated by:

1. predicting values from a fitted model ($\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1$) ...

&emsp; **and**

2. ... adding normally distributed errors.


## Recall: Linear Regression

This method produces data that perfectly agree with the linear model conditions:

&emsp; **L**inear relationship between $x$ and $y$.

&emsp; **I**ndependence of observations.

&emsp; **N**ormality of residuals.

&emsp; **E**qual variance of residuals.


## Predictive Checks

If we compare data generated from the linear model to the observed data, we can determine how well the observed data and linear model fit.

+ Is it plausible that the observed data could be generated by the model?


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. Fit a regression model to the observed data.

2. For a set of explanatory values, obtain predicted response values from the model.

3. Add random errors to the predictions.

4. Compare the simulated data to the observed data.

5. Iterate!


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. **Fit a regression model to the observed data.**


##

Use the `lm()` function...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks_1.png")
```


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. Fit a regression model to the observed data.

2. **For a set of explanatory values, obtain predicted response values from the model.**


##

Use the `predict()` function...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks_2.png")
```


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. Fit a regression model to the observed data.

2. For a set of explanatory values, obtain predicted response values from the model.

3. **Add random errors to the predictions.**


##

Use the `rnorm()` function...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 55%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks_3.png")
```

The random errors have mean 0 and standard deviation estimated by the **residual standard error** (use `sigma()`).


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. Fit a regression model to the observed data.

2. For a set of explanatory values, obtain predicted response values from the model.

3. Add random errors to the predictions.

4. **Compare the simulated data to the observed data.**


##

Use the `lm()` function to regress observed on simulated...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks_4.png")
```

To measure similarity, record $R^2$ (proportion of variability in $y$ explained by a linear relationship with $x$).


## The Process

To perform a predictive check...

1. Fit a regression model to the observed data.

2. For a set of explanatory values, obtain predicted response values from the model.

3. Add random errors to the predictions.

4. Compare the simulated data to the observed data.

5. **Iterate!**


##

Use the `map()` function to repeat the process over and over...

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="70%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks_5.png")
```
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
We want to see how the model performs across many simulated datasets.

+ Compute the $R^2$ for each.
:::
::::

Instead of $R^2$, could use correlation $(r)$, sum of squared errors $(SSE)$, or the estimate of $\sigma$ $(RMSE)$ to measure similarity.


## Distribution of Simulated $R^2$

Plot the distribution of simulated $R^2$ values to see how well the model performs.

+ Values distributed near 1 indicate a good fit!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 85%
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("images/predchecks-5.jpg")
```


## For your project...

For your group project, you will run predictive checks to assess how well your model performs.
